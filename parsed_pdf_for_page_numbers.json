And although, according to her judgment, there be not any thing in it contrary to the Word of God, or to sound doctrine, or which a godly man may not with a good con-science use and submit unto, or which is not fairly defensible, if allowed such  just and favourable construction as in common equity ought to be allowed tov"

        "text": "Prefaceall human writings; yet upon the principles already laid down, it cannot but be supposed that further alterations would in time be found expedient. Accordingly, a Commission for a review was issued in the year 1689: but this great and good work miscarried at that time; and the Civil Authority has not  since thought proper to revive it by any new Commission.But when in the course of Divine Providence, these American States be- came independent with respect to civil government, their ecclesiastical inde-pendence was necessarily included; and the different religious denominations of Christians in these States were left at full and equal liberty to model and organize their respective Churches, and forms of worship, and disci- pline, in such manner as they might judge most convenient for their future prosperity; consistently with the constitution and laws of their country.The attention of this Church was in the first place drawn to those alter-ations in the Liturgy which became necessary in the prayers for our Civil Rulers, in consequence of the Revolution. And the principal care herein was to make them conformable to what ought to be the pro per end of all such prayers, namely, that \u201cRulers may have grace, wisdom, and understanding to execute justice, and to maintain truth\u201d; and that the people \u201cmay lead quiet and peaceable lives, in all godliness and honesty.\u201dBut while these alterations were in review before the Convention, they could not but, with gratitude to God, embrace the happy occasion which was offered to them (uninfluenced and unrestrained by any worldly authority  whatsoever) to take a further review of the Public Service, and to establish such other altera-tions and amendments therein as might be deemed expedient.It seems unnecessary to enumerate all the different alterations and amend-ments. They will appear, and it is to be hoped, the reasons of them also,  upon a comparison of this with the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England. In which it will also appear that this Church is far from in- tending to depart from the Church of England in any essential point of doc-trine, discipline, or worship; or further than local circumstances require.And now, this important work being brought to a conclusion, it is hoped the whole will be received and examined by every true member of our Church, and every sincere Christian, with a meek, candid, and charitable frame of mind; without prejudice or pre possessions; seriously considering what Christianity is, and what the truths of the Gospel are; and earnestly beseeching Almighty God to accompany with his blessing every endeavour for promulgating them to mankind in the clearest, plainest, most affecting and majestic manner, for the sake of Jesus Christ, our blessed Lord and  Saviour.Philadelphia, October, 1789."

The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Pre-pare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of re- pentance for the remission of sins. And there went out unto him all the land of Jud\u00e6a, and they of Jerusalem, and  were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. And John was clothed with camel\u2019s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and  wild honey; and preached, saying, There cometh one might-ier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose. I indeed have baptized  you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jor-dan.

And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine. Jesus saith unto her, Woman,  what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come. His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith  unto you, do it.

And they filled them up to the brim. And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bride-groom, and saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk,  then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.

Who is among you that feareth the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light? let him trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon his God.

AND straightway in the morning the chief priests held   a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate. And Pilate asked him, Art thou  the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it. And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many  things they witness against thee. But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled. Now at that feast he re-leased unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had com- mitted murder in the insurrection. And the multitude cry-ing aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that  I release unto you the King of the Jews? For he knew  that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them. And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? And they cried out again, Crucify him. Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceed- ingly, Crucify him. And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. And the sol- diers led him away into the hall, called Pr\u00e6torium; and they call together the whole band. And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, and began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!

For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at  all while the testator liveth. Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without blood. For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with  water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the  book and all the people, saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you. Moreover, he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the ves- sels of the ministry. And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no  remission. It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. For Christ is not entered into the holy places made  with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for 147"

These things therefore the soldiers did. Now there stood by the cross of Jesus  his mother, and his mother\u2019s sister, Mary the wife of Cleo- phas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son! Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst. Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sab- bath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 160"

And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon\u2019s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little  from the land. And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. And Simon answering said unto him,  Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: never-theless at thy word I will let down the net. And when  they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of  fishes: and their net brake. And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus\u2019 knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: and so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon.

THE LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords,   a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regard- eth not persons, nor taketh reward: he doth execute the judg-ment of the fatherless and widow, and loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment. Love ye there- fore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the land of  Egypt. Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name. He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee  these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.263"

The Lord gave, and the Lord  hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.  & After they are come into the Church, shall be said one or more of the following Selections, taken from the Psalms. The Gloria Patri may be omitted except at the end of the whole portion or selection  from the Psalter.Dixi, custodiam. Psalm xxxix. LORD, let me know mine end, and the number of my   days; * that I may be certified how long I have to live.Behold, thou hast made my days as it were a span long, and mine age is even as nothing in respect of thee; * and verily every man living is altogether vanity.For man walketh in a vain shadow, and disquieteth him-self in vain; * he heapeth up riches, and cannot tell who shall gather them.And now, Lord, what is my hope? * truly my hope is  even in thee.Deliver me from all mine offences; * and make me not  a rebuke unto the foolish.324"

Thou foolish one, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall  be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain: but God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed its own body. All flesh is not the same flesh:  but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds. There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is an- other. There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star dif- fereth from another star in glory. So also is the resurrec- tion of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption: it is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power: it is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body. And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was  made a quickening spirit. Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy: the  second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are  they also that are heavenly.

And grant that the course of this world may be so peaceably ordered by thy governance, that thy Church may joyfully serve thee in all godly quietness; that so they may walk in the ways of truth and peace, and at last be numbered with thy Saints in glory everlasting; through the merits of the same thy blessed Son Jesus Christ, the gracious Bishop and Shepherd of our souls, who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Holy Ghost, one God,  world without end.

Of Faith in the Holy Trinity.THERE is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts,   or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and   Preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in the unity of this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.II.  Of the Word or Son of God, which was made very Man.The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father, took Man\u2019s nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two whole and perfect Natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one Person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God, and very Man; who truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt,  but also for actual sins of men.III.  Of the going down of Christ into Hell.As Christ died for us, and was buried; so also it is to be believed, that he went down into Hell.IV.  Of the Resurrection of Christ.Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again his body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of Man\u2019s nature; where- with he ascended into Heaven, and there sitteth, until he return to judge all  Men at the last day.V.  Of the Holy Ghost.The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God.VI.  Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation.Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatso- ever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical Books of the Old and New Testament, of whose  authority was never any doubt in the Church.Of the Names and Number of the Canonical BooksGenesis,  Exodus,  Leviticus,  Numbers,  Deuteronomy,  Joshua,  Judges,  Ruth, The First Book of Samuel, The Second Book of Samuel, The First Book of Kings, The Second Book of Kings, The First Book of Chronicles, The Second Book of Chronicles, The First Book of Esdras, The Second Book of Esdras, The Book of Esther,The Book of Job,The Psalms, The Proverbs,Ecclesiastes or Preacher,Cantica, or Songs of Solomon,Four Prophets the greater,Twelve Prophets the less.603"

Of the Old Testament.The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard, which feign that the old Fathers did look only for transi- tory promises. Although the Law given from God by Moses, as touching Cere-monies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstand- ing, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the Command-ments which are called Moral.VIII.  Of the Creeds.The Nicene Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles\u2019 Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed: for they may be proved by  most certain warrants of Holy Scripture.IX.  Of Original or Birth Sin.Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam, (as the Pelagians do vainly talk;) but it is the fault and corruption of the Nature of every man, that nat-urally is engendered of the offspring of Adam; whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the Spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God\u2019s wrath and damnation. And this in-fection of nature doth remain, yea in them that are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in Greek, \uf066\uf072\uf06f\uf06e\uf068\uf06d\uf061 \uf073\uf061\uf072\uf06b\uf06f\uf056, (which some do expound the wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the desire, of the flesh), is not subject to the Law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized; yet the Apostle doth confess, that con- cupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.X.  Of Free Will.The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant 604"

Of the Justification of Man.We are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith, and not for our own works or deservings. Where-fore, that we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholesome Doctrine, and  very full of comfort, as more largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification.XII.  Of Good Works.Albeit that Good Works, which are the fruits of Faith, and follow after Jus-tification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God\u2019s judg-ment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith; insomuch that by them a lively  Faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit.XIII.  Of Works before Justification.Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspiration of the Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ; neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School-authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea rather, for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have  the nature of sin.XIV.  Of Works of Supererogation.Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God\u2019s Commandments, which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and  impiety: for by them men do declare, that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to, but that they do more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required: whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done  all that are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants.XV.  Of Christ alone without Sin.Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin only except, from which he was clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his spirit. He came to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself once made, should take away the sins of the world; and sin (as Saint John saith) was not in him. But all we the rest, although baptized, and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things; and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,  and the truth is not in us.XVI.  Of Sin after Baptism.Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of 605"

And therefore they are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin as long as they live here, or  deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.XVII.  Of Predestination and ElectionPredestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby (before the foundations of the world were laid) he hath constantly decreed by his coun- sel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to honour. Wherefore, they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God, be called according to God\u2019s purpose by his Spirit working in due season: they through Grace obey the calling: they be justified freely: they be made sons of God by adoption: they be made like the image of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ: they walk religiously in good works,  and at length, by God\u2019s mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our Election in Christ,  is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works  of the flesh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their mind to high and  heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fer- vently kindle their love towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lack- ing the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God\u2019s Predestination, is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them either into desperation, or into wrethchlessness of most unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.Furthermore, we must receive God\u2019s promises in such wise, as they be gen-erally set forth to us in Holy Scripture: and, in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which we have expressly declared unto us in the Word of  God.XVIII.  Of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the Name of Christ.They also are to be had accursed that presume to say, That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that Law, and the light of Nature.  For Holy Scrip- ture doth set out unto us only the Name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must  be saved.XIX.  Of the Church.The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments be duly ministered ac- cording to Christ\u2019s ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requi- site to the same. As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch, have erred; so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of Cere- monies, but also in matters of Faith.606"

Of the Authority of the Church.The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and authority in Con-troversies of Faith: and yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain any thing  that is contrary to God\u2019s Word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to decree any thing against the same, so besides the same ought not to enforce any thing  to be believed for necessity of Salvation.XXI.  Of the Authority of General Councils.[The Twenty-first of the former Articles is omitted; because it is partly of a local and civil nature, and is provided for, as to the remaining parts of it, in other Articles.]XXII.  Of Purgatory.The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, Worshipping and Ado-ration, as well of Images as of Relics, and also Invocation of Saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.XXIII.  Of Ministering in the CongregationIt is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, before he be lawfully called, and sent to execute the same. And those we ought to judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men who have public authority given unto them in the Congregation, to call and send Min- isters into the Lord\u2019s vineyard.XXIV.  Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a Tongue as the people understandeth.It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the Primitive Church, to have public Prayer in the Church, or to minister the Sac-raments, in a tongue not understanded of the people.XXV.  Of the Sacraments.Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men\u2019s profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and God\u2019s good will towards us, by the which he doth work invisi- bly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm our  Faith in him.There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that  is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord.Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Pen-ance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacra-ments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt fol- lowing of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like nature of Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lord\u2019s Supper,  for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.607"

And in such only as worth- ily receive the same, they have a wholesome effect or operation: but they that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.XXVI.  Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect  of the Sacraments.Although in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometimes the evil have chief authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacraments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in Christ\u2019s, and do minister by his commission and authority, we may use their Ministry, both in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving the Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ\u2019s ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God\u2019s gifts diminished from such as by faith, and rightly,  do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them; which be effectual, because of Christ\u2019s institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church, that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge  of their offences; and finally, being found guilty, by just judgment be deposed.XVII.  Of BaptismBaptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby Christian men are discerned from others that be not christened, but it is also a sign of Regeneration or New-Birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the promises of the for-giveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are visibly signed and sealed; Faith is confirmed, and Grace increased by vir- tue of prayer unto God.The Baptism of young Children is in any wise to be retained in the Church,  as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.XVIII.  Of the Lord\u2019s Supper.The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another; but rather it is a Sacrament of our Redemption by Christ\u2019s death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ; and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the Blood  of Christ.Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and  hath given occasion to many superstitions.The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.The Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper was not by Christ\u2019s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.608"

Of the Wicked, which eat not the Body of Christ in the use of the Lord\u2019s Supper.The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as Saint Augustine saith) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ; yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do eat and drink the sign or Sacrament of  so great a thing.XXX.  Of both Kinds.The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people: for both the parts of the Lord\u2019s Sacrament, by Christ\u2019s ordinance and commandment, ought to  be ministered to all Christian men alike.XXXI.

Wherefore the sacri- fices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were  blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.XXXII.  Of the Marriage of Priests.Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by God\u2019s Law, either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage: therefore it is law- ful for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own discretion,  as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.XXXIII.  Of excommunicate Persons, how they are to be avoided.That person which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off from the unity of the Church, and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be openly reconciled by penance, and received into the Church by a Judge that  hath the authority thereunto.XXXIV.  Of the Traditions of the Church.It is not necessary that the Traditions and Ceremonies be in all places one, or utterly like; for at all times they have been divers, and may be changed ac-cording to the diversity of countries, times, and men\u2019s manners, so that noth-ing be ordained against God\u2019s Word. Whosoever, through his private judg- ment, willingly and purposely, doth openly break the Traditions and Cere- monies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do the like,) as he that offendeth against the common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority of the Magistrate, and woundeth  the consciences of the weak brethren.Every particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and 609"

But all references to the constitution and laws of England are considered as inapplicable to the circumstances of this Church; which also suspends the order for the reading of said Homilies in churches, until a revision of them may be conveniently made, for the clearing of them, as well from  obsolete words and phrases, as from the local references.]XXXVI.  Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers.The Book of Consecration of Bishops, and Ordering of Priests and Deacons, as set forth by the General Convention of this Church in 1792, doth contain all things necessary to such Consecration and Ordering; neither hath it any thing that, of itself, is superstitious and ungodly.
