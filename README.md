# simeon-gpt
Utility project that uses large language models to parse unstructured text like the Book of Common Prayer 1928.

## What's with the name?
The eastern church believes that he translated the Hebrew torah into Greek (the Septuagint) in Alexandria. As the story goes, Simeon was preparing to translate Isaiah 41:7 into a "a woman will conceive and bear a son" thinking a mistake had been made, when an angel appeared, corrected him, and told him that he would see the coming messiah born of a virgin. Years later, he composed the Nunc Dimittis when he received Christ in the temple. 

It is our goal with this project to translate the 1928 BCP into another language (namely, machine language), such that we may later make beautiful things for the Church.
