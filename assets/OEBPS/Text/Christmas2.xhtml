  <p class="centered italic">The Collect.</p>

  <p>ALMIGHTY God, who hast poured upon us the new light of thine incarnate Word; Grant that the same light enkindled in our hearts may shine forth in our lives; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</p>

  <p class="centered"><i>For the Epistle.</i> Isaiah lxi. 1.</p>

  <p>THE Spirit of the Lord <span class="smallcaps">God</span> is upon me; because the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span>, that he might be glorified.</p>

  <p class="centered"><i>The Gospel.</i> St. Matthew ii. 19.</p>

  <p>WHEN Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young childâ€™s life. And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel. But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene.</p>
