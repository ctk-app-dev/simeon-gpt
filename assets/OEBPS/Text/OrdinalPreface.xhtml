  <p class="centered">The Form and Manner of Making, Ordaining, and&nbsp;Consecrating</p>

  <h1 class="sigilNotInTOC" id="heading_id_2">Bishops, Priests, and&nbsp;Deacons</h1>

  <p class="centered">according to the Order of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America, as established by the Bishops, the Clergy, and Laity of said Church, in General Convention, September,&nbsp;A.D.&nbsp;1792</p>

  <p class="centered">THE PREFACE.</p>

  <p class="small italic">IT is evident unto all men, diligently reading Holy Scripture and ancient Authors, that from the Apostles’ time there have been these Orders of Ministers in Christ’s Church, — Bishops, Priests, and Deacons. Which Offices were evermore had in such reverend estimation, that no man might presume to execute any of them, except he were first called, tried, examined, and known to have such qualities as are requisite for the same; and also by public Prayer, with Imposition of Hands, were approved and admitted thereunto by lawful Authority. And therefore, to the intent that these Orders may be continued, and reverently used and esteemed in this Church, no man shall be accounted or taken to be a lawful Bishop, Priest, or Deacon, in this Church, or suffered to execute any of the said Functions, except he be called, tried, examined, and admitted thereunto, according to the Form hereafter following, or hath had Episcopal Consecration or Ordination.</p>

  <p class="small italic">And none shall be admitted a Deacon, Priest, or Bishop, except he be of the age which the Canon in that case provided may require.</p>

  <p class="small italic">And the Bishop, knowing either by himself, or by sufficient testimony, any Person to be a man of virtuous conversation, and without crime, and, after examination and trial, finding him sufficiently instructed in the Holy Scripture, and otherwise learned as the Canons require, may, at the times appointed, or else, on urgent occasion, upon some other day, in the face of the Church, admit him a Deacon, in such manner and form as followeth.</p>
